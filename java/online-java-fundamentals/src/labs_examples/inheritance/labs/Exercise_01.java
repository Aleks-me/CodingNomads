/**
 * Inheritance Exercise 1:
 *
 *      1) Create one super class Class1 and two subclasses Class2 and Class3.
 *          -Class2 should extend Class1.
 *          -Class3 should extend Class2.
 *      2) Each class should have at least two instance variable, all private.
 *      3) Create getters and setters for all instance variables and demonstrate setting superclass
 *          variables from a subclass
 *      4) Demonstrate the use of (non getter and setter) methods in a superclass from a subclass.
 *      5) Add constructors to each class and demonstrate the use of a superclass constructor
 *          from a subclass.
 *      6) Demonstrate constructor overloading and the use of the "super" keyword.
 *      7) Demonstrate method overloading.
 *
 *      NOTE: We encourage you to be creative and try to think of an example of your own for this
 *       exercise but if you are stuck, some ideas include:
 *
 *       - A Vehicle superclass, with Truck and Motorcycle subclasses.
 *       - A Restaurant superclass, with Gourmet and FastFood subclasses.
