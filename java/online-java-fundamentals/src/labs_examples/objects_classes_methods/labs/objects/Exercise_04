Building off the previous classes we created in Exercise_01

1) Create a toString() method in each POJO. You can do this by holding down the Control key and hitting
enter at the same time. If you see a small menu choose toString() and generate from there. Otherwise you can
select "Code" from the top most navbar of IntelliJ and then select "Generate" and choose toString();

2) In the main() method you created in the controller classes demonstrate creating a number of Objects using a variety
of constructors that you created in the previous exercise.

3) After creating these objects, print the status of these objects. For example:
System.out.println(cardObj.toString())
