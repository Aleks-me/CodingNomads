'''
Write a script that takes in a number from the user as input and prints the following structure.

Suppose the input is 5, you will output
*
* *
* * * 
* * * *
* * * * * 
i.e. number of rows will be 5, 1st row will have 1 star, 2nd row will have 2 stars, 3rd row 3 stars, 4th row will have 4 stars and 5th row will have 5 stars.

Another example: if input is 3, you will output
*
* *
* * *

Hint: Think of nested for loops

'''

inp_num = int(input("Enter the number > 0: "))

for i in range(0, inp_num+1):
    if inp_num == 0:
        print("Zero stars.")
    else:
        print("* " * i)
