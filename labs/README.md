## Push me to your GitHub

You should see this document after you have downloaded the sample code. 
This folder contains **your own copy** of all the labs and that we will be working with.

Start completing the exercises locally on your computer. After you've
learned about Git and GitHub, add a new remote to the folder that points
to a fresh GitHub repository on your own GitHub account.

Push your work there, and inform the course instructors by sending a
link on our communication platform.


### Contributing

There is always room for improvement for our material, and as a budding
software developer, learning to contribute to a project is a great first
step e.g. to get into open-source. Therefore remember:


**We appreciate `pull` requests!**


If you don't yet know what that means, no worries! Either come back later,
or read the links below. Basically, it's easy:


If you **find a typo**, or a **mistake in the code** - or you **want to add an
exercise of your own for other students to learn from** - you can suggest
these improvements to the original repository.
