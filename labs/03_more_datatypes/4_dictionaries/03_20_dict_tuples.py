CHALLENGE: Write a script that sorts a dictionary into a list of tuples based on values. For example:

input_dict = {"item1": 5, "item2": 6, "item3": 1}
result_list = [("item3", 1), ("item1", 5), ("item2", 6)]

NOTE: Check out the Python docs and see whether you can come up with a solution, even if you don't yet
      completely understand _why_ it works the way it does:

      Feel free to discuss any questions you have with your mentor and on the forum!
