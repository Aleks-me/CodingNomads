Take in 10 numbers from the user. Place the numbers in a list.
Find the largest number in the list.
Print the results.

CHALLENGE: Calculate the product of all of the numbers in the list.
(you will need to use "looping" - a concept common to list operations
that we haven't looked at yet. See if you can figure it out, otherwise
come back to this task after you have learned about loops)
